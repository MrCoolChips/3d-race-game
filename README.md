# MERY Speed

MERY Speed is more than just a university racing game; it's a 3D racing experience developed by a team of four passionate, curious, and determined students. This project aims to deliver an original and strategic racing game where every detail of the gameplay matters. 

About the Project
MERY Speed was conceived as an ambitious challenge to create a fun, deep, and engaging racing game. Unlike typical speed-focused games, MERY Speed requires players to constantly adapt, anticipate, and make tactical decisions. Inspired by classics like Mario Kart, Crash Team Racing, and Blur, the game features an unpredictable environment with traps, shortcuts, and challenging AI opponents designed to change the outcome of a race at any moment. 

The name "MERY Speed" is an acronym formed from the first initials of the team members: Micipssa, Egemen, Rayane, and Yanis. This name symbolizes the collaborative spirit, creativity, and energy that powered the project. The "Speed" in the title emphasizes the core essence of the game: exhilarating races and adrenaline-pumping moments. 

# Features
**Gameplay Mechanics**

**MERY Speed offers an immersive racing experience with strategic choices at every turn. Key gameplay features include:**

*Race Settings: Before each race, players configure settings such as the number of participants (up to 8), number of laps (up to 5), and vehicle types to race against (Random, Same, or All). 
*Vehicle Selection: Players can choose from different vehicle types, each with unique characteristics like top speed, acceleration, handling, and collision resistance, directly influencing gameplay. 

**Circuit Selection: The game features two distinct circuits:**

*Urban Circuit: A self-designed cartoon-style urban track with a destroyed bridge, ramps, tunnels, and strategic alternate paths. 
*Technical Circuit: A more challenging track with traps (oil slicks, radars), boost zones, and shortcuts, designed for tactical racing. 
*Interactive Environments: Circuits include diverse textures like snow (slippery surfaces), sand (slows vehicles), and lava (causes damage), adding dynamic challenges. Obstacles like oil slicks, forest elements (trunks, puddles), and other interactive objects further adapt difficulty and make each race unique. 


**Driving Mechanics:**

*Acceleration and Braking: Standard controls for vehicle speed. 
*Steering and Handling: Vehicle responsiveness varies based on type and circuit. 
*Countdown: A 3-second countdown prepares players for race start, synchronizing with AI opponents. 
*Boost System: Boost recharges based on speed and capacity, with a 5-second cooldown after full use. Boost power-ups are scattered on tracks. 
*Rewind Function: Players have three rewind attempts per race, allowing them to reverse their vehicle up to 5 seconds to avoid accidents. 
*Health System: Each vehicle has a health value; hitting zero causes respawn at the last checkpoint, incurring a significant time penalty. 
*Mouse Control: An intuitive mouse control scheme allows for smoother turns: left-click to go forward, right-click to go backward, and mouse movement for steering. 
*Mini-Map: Displays player (red arrow) and opponent positions, crucial for strategic navigation. 
*Mid-Air Control: Players can rotate their vehicle in the air to prevent landing upside down after jumps or collisions, and performing a 360-degree rotation earns in-game currency. 
*Collisions: Impacts with obstacles, other vehicles, or track edges result in slowdowns or penalties. 
*Realistic Physics: Friction, gravity, and grip are accounted for based on terrain. 
*Chrono System: Tracks race time for performance evaluation, ranking (future version), and personal record comparison. 
*Interactive Circuit Elements: Radars penalize speeding (over 120 km/h, except for police vehicles) with a 5-second freeze. Oil slicks cause temporary loss of control. Boost arrows provide temporary speed boosts. Obstacles force players to adapt their driving to avoid damage or slowdowns. Health kits allow players to regenerate vehicle health during races. 
*Strategic Racing: The game emphasizes strategic decision-making through traps, shortcuts, and environmental interactions. 


**Vehicles and Characteristics: Each vehicle type has unique speed, handling, durability, and acceleration, affecting performance across different terrains:**

*4x4 (SUV): Robust and ideal for difficult terrains, unaffected by special textures like sand, snow, or lava. 
*Racing Vehicle: Ultra-fast but fragile, designed for high-speed enthusiasts. Incurs a 25% ecological tax on winnings due to environmental damage caused. 
*Police Vehicle: Balanced in speed and stability, unaffected by radars. Can gain a speed bonus when close to a target vehicle and fully recharges boost upon respawn. 
*Vintage Vehicle: Offers a nostalgic, moderate performance, with a rapidly recharging but less powerful boost effect. 
*Opponent AI: AI vehicles manage collisions, benefit from track improvements and traps, follow multiple trajectories (making them less predictable), and use turbo strategically. 
*Earning and Reward System: Money is earned by finishing in the top half of participants, with higher positions yielding greater rewards. The number of laps also influences potential earnings. Reward amounts also vary based on the chosen race type (Random, All) and the player's vehicle type. 


# User Interface and Menus

**MERY Speed features several interactive menus designed for an immersive user experience:**

*Home Screen: A greeting screen that allows Unity to stabilize before loading the main menu. 
*Main Menu: The central hub for accessing all other menus, including starting a new race. Designed to resemble a garage, with the selected vehicle displayed. 
*Loading Screen: An interactive loading screen with a minimalist black background, a red progress bar, and a stylized red racing car, maintaining player engagement and game immersion. 
*Shop: Players can browse and purchase different vehicles, view their statistics, type, and price. Owned vehicles are marked as "OWNED." Vehicles can be rotated for detailed viewing. 
*Upgrade Menu: Offers five types of upgrades with 5 levels each (except color change): Engine (max speed), Brakes (braking efficiency), Turbo (boost capacity), Acceleration (acceleration speed), and Color Change (four colors available). *Upgrade prices vary by type and vehicle. 
*Settings Menu: Allows adjustment of background music volume, graphics quality (shadows for FPS optimization), display mode (fullscreen/windowed), and resolution (for windowed mode). 
*Statistics Menu: Provides a comprehensive summary of player performance, including total races, wins/losses, coins earned, vehicle usage statistics, and best lap times. 
*Controls Menu: Allows players to learn and customize key bindings, especially for actions like boost, to accommodate different keyboard layouts. 
*Pause Menu: Accessible during races via the "Enter" key, freezing the game and offering options to resume or exit, ensuring a stress-free interruption. 
*Sound Management: Integrates essential sounds for vehicle engines (distinct for each vehicle, looped when moving, stopped when still), collisions (triggered by impact force, with driver reactions), and random background music in menus. Sounds are optimized and separated for clarity. 


# Educational Objectives & Learnings

**This project served as a comprehensive learning opportunity, fostering key skills in:**

*Programming: C# development with Unity, gameplay logic, collision management, and movement scripts. 
*Modeling and Design: 3D model integration, textures, environment creation, and camera management. 
*User Interface: Creation of menus (vehicle selection, circuit, race start), chrono display, and score. 
*Project Management: Time organization, deadline adherence, documentation, and testing. 

The team gained practical knowledge and real experience in video game development, understanding both the technical aspects and the creative and organizational challenges involved in creating a complete game. 

# Inspiration

**MERY Speed draws inspiration from racing game classics:**

*Mario Kart: For its fun, accessible nature, and diverse circuits and vehicles. 
*Beach Buggy Racing: A mobile game known for its traps, boost ramps, car acrobatics, and stunts. 
The goal was not to replicate these games but to adapt their best ideas into a personal and educational project, emphasizing visual identity, replayability, and clear progression.
